## WHAT IS CIVILIANSMOD?

**CiviliansMod is a great way to bring your survival/creative world to another level. Let's say you are working on a city, town, village, etc. Similar to how villagers are in Minecraft villages, CiviliansMod will make it come alive! In a world with your friends, or just yourself, fill the empty areas of your place with active NPCs! The NPCs will look like players in your world and will walk around, go in and out of your buildings, talk to you and more!**

### ROUGH BREAKDOWN ON HOW THE MOD WORKS

>**By crafting a custom item called 'NPC Totem', you use that totem on an unassigned villager. Once you right click that villager it will then be converted to a random default civilian. If you don't like the default attributes, just sneak + right click the NPC and a custom GUI will appear. You can change the name to whatever you like and also scroll through the many different skin variations to match whatever theme or vibe you're going for!**

### WHAT ALL CAN THE NPC DO
>**As of right now, they have no purpose other than to bring more realism into your world that you create. Their purpose is to make it feel like there are actually civilians living >and wandering around what you create! But here are the list of what they do.**
>
- Walk Around
- Go in and out of buildings
- You can right click them to get dialogues
- If they are hurt they will also say some different dialogues
- Customizable to fit your theme

## HOW TO BRING A CIVILIAN IN TO YOUR WORLD

1. Craft an NPC Totem // You need to obtain 8 redstone and 1 amethyst shard and bring them to a crafting table.
2. Put the amethyst in the middle, and then redstone dust all around. Then grab your new NPC Totem item.
3. Go to an unassigned villager and right click them to transform them into an NPC! **ITS THAT EASY**  
- Tip: Somehow get a villager to where you are building first, or make a villager breeder to have them at disposal.
